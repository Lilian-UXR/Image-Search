# Image Gif Search

A website to search for Gifs using the Giphy API.
Created by Lilian Lim

# Overview

The project is to help showcase my skill set in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I kept the rating of the output to be PG to have the API search output more friendly images.

# Functionality Available

In the project, you will be able to enter image gifs you are looking for in the search bar and search for gifs.

# Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create this project along with figma to help create a low fidelity wireframe. Google fonts is also used to support the styling of the fonts of the webpage. Giphy API is also used for this project to display image gifs.

# Future improvements

Future improvements to the website to allow users to specify the amount of image Gifs they would like to be displayed, specifiy the rating of images, and allow for users to specify languages they would like the images to be in.
